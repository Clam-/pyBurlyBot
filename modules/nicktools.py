# nicktools

# Handles identifying to nickserv (when not using client certificate fingerprints)
# and restoring original nickname when available.
# Currently only implemented for Rizon's nickserv implementation.

# SPECIAL NOTE:
# Rizon does not send a NICK event when connecting so this module uses the "signedOn" BurlyBot event
# to check intial nick. If a different server does send a NICK event on connection, then mappings will
# need to be dynamically managed for that type of server else you'll get two simutanious "nickCheckAndRecover"
# actions.
